# InteractiveConversationalAgent
The Interactive Conversational Agent allows an individual to hold a conversation of at least 30 turns. For our COSC310 project our bot will be a celebrity and our user can be anyone. The celebrity chosen is Kanye West. The conversation will be primarily question/answer based, but there may be certain specific responses for some non-question statements. 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

â€¢ A README file included in the repository to explain what the project is about, how to compile and run the code.
The README file describes how your classes are organized. If you need to include a diagram to illustrate your class organization, use a README.doc or README.pdf rather than a txt file.
